**Available for work full time as a Junior Developer in London, UK**

Inquisitive and resourceful problem-solver with an articulate eye for detail and passion for UX and building all things beautiful.  

Trained as an architect with 8 years of design and project management experience across 3 continents, I fell in love with the power of code to turn ideas into scalable solutions that can transform people's lives.  

This led me to complete a 12 weeks coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. Check out my Makers Academy winning [**blog: Mongolian Princess Codes**](http://www.mongolianprincess.net).

I am seeking opportunity as a junior developer to continue learning (and playing ping pong) with a focus on TDD/BDD and software craftmanship.  Eager to share my fresh perspective and contribute to a dynamic team that values collaboration, innovation and open source development.
