===========

**Available for work full time as a Junior Developer in London, UK**

Inquisitive and resourceful problem-solver with an articulated eye for details and passion for end user experience and building all things beautiful.  

Trained as an architect with 8 years of design and project management experience across 3 continents, I fell in love with the power of code to turn ideas into scalable solutions that can transform people's lives.  

This led me to complete a 12 weeks coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. 

I am seeking opportunity as a junior developer to continue learning (and playing ping pong) with a focus on TDD/BDD and software craftmanship.  Eager to share my fresh perspective and contribute to a dynamic team that values collaboration and innovation.
