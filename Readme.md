**Available for work full time as a Junior Developer in London, UK**

Inquisitive and resourceful problem-solver with an articulate eye for detail.  I am passionate about social entrepreneurship and building a knowledge sharing community.  

Having trained as an architect with 8 years of design and project management experience across 3 continents, I fell in love with the power of technology to turn ideas into scalable solutions that can disruptively transform people's lives, especially those at the bottom of the pyramid. 

This led me to complete a 12 weeks coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. Check out my winning blog from Makers Academy blogging competition [**Mongolian Princess Codes**](http://www.mongolianprincess.net).

I am seeking opportunity as a junior developer to continue learning and bridging the gap between design and software engineering with a focus on TDD/BDD and software craftmanship.  Eager to share my fresh perspective and contribute to a dynamic team that values collaboration, innovation and open source development.
