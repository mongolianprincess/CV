I am passionate about making sustainable software (simplicity over complexity) and building a knowledge sharing community.

I am seeking opportunity as a full stack software engineer to continue learning and making everyday life a tiny bit better via tech with a people centric focus on softweare craftpersonship.  Eager to share my fresh perspective and contribute to a dynamic team that values collaboration, innovation and open source development.
