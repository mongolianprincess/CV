===========

**Available for work as a Junior Developer in London, UK**

Curious and resourceful problem-solver with an articulated eye for design and passion for mapping and data visualization.  

Trained as an architect with eight years of design and project management experience across three continents, I fell in love with the magic of code to turn ideas into scalable solutions that are accessible to all. Recently completed a 12 weeks coding bootcamp at Makers Academy in London UK. 

Currently seeking full time opportunity as a junior developer to further my professional growth with a focus on TDD/BDD, software software craftmanship to contribute to a team who values collaboration and innovation.
